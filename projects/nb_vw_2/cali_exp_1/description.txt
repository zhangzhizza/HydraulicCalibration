use 2020 first 50 rows of data for calibration

simulation: calibration_2_param_dist.json, 42+69 runs for sensitivity analysis.  but only selected MAPE within 15%

in the first 50 rows of data, pump 9 and 10 are all zero, and pump 11 and 12 have the same frequency, so these three columns are deleted, only keep 1

down sampling thres 0.8
